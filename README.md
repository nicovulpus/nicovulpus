## 🚀 About Me

🧠 I'm a fresh face in the developer world, currently leveling up through a coding bootcamp — and soon, the workforce!  
💻 I enjoy clean code, logic puzzles, and breaking things just to fix them better.  
📚 I recharge with books, meditation, mathematics, martial arts, and of course — more programming.
